### Setup Web Map Application

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

#### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
# run app local
serve -s dist
```
